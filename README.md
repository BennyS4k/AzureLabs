# 🧪 Azure Hands-On Lab Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Azure infrastructure and security labs I’ve built to gain hands-on experience and showcase my skills in real-world cloud environments.

## 🔍 Overview

Each lab is designed to simulate practical scenarios that align with cloud support, infrastructure, and security roles. All configurations were completed manually using the Azure CLI and portal, within a free-tier subscription.

## 📦 Included Labs

- ✅ Resource group and virtual network setup
- ✅ VM deployment with subnet isolation
- ✅ Network Security Groups (NSG) configuration
- ✅ Azure Storage (Blob & File) with secure access
- ✅ Backup and restore configuration for VMs
- ✅ Azure Monitor & Alerts
- ✅ Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Sentinel basics

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Azure CLI scripting
- Infrastructure-as-Code (light)
- Identity and access management
- Network design and segmentation
- Monitoring, alerting, and basic SIEM usage
- Backup and disaster recovery setup

## 📂 Structure

Each lab has its own folder containing:
- A `README.md` with what I built and what I learned
- CLI scripts and config files (where applicable)
- Screenshots for visual reference

## 🎯 Goal

This project supports my transition into a cloud security-focused role, building on my existing 3rd Line Infrastructure background and certifications such as AZ-900, SC-900, and AZ-104.
