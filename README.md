# Azure Hands-On Lab Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of practical Azure labs I’ve built to gain real, hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and security tools.

## What’s Included

These labs simulate real-world scenarios aligned with cloud support and security roles. All work was completed manually using:
- **Azure CLI (in Azure Cloud Shell)**
- **Terraform (for Infrastructure-as-Code)**
- - **Bicep/ARM (for Infrastructure-as-Code)**
- **Azure Portal (for validation and visibility)**

Key areas covered:
- Resource groups, VNets, and subnets  
- VM deployments with NSG rules  
- Azure Storage with access controls  
- Monitoring, alerts, and backup setup  
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud basics  
- IaC using Terraform to deploy secure, repeatable infrastructure

## Format

Each lab folder contains:
- A `README.md` outlining what was built and why  
- CLI scripts or Terraform configs  
- Screenshots showing the final deployment or configuration

## About Me

I currently work in 3rd Line Infrastructure Support and am transitioning toward a cloud security-focused role. This portfolio reflects my hands-on learning journey alongside certifications like **AZ-900**, **SC-900**, and **AZ-104** (in progress).
